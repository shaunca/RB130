A
create beersong class

beersong will have a class method verse that takes one argument, one verse
the beersong lyrics method return value will be converted to a new array using split with new lines
use the verse num argument as index indicator to pull out the verse we need from the array
return that value, if the verse is the last verse, do not append a newline, otherwise, do so.

the verses class mathod takes two arguments, starting verse and last verse
x = starting verse - last verse + 1 will determine how many verses we need to pull out
for x times, call the verse method and append the return value to an array
append the verse values to the result var array and concatenate it using a newline.

create lyrics class method that can pull up the lyrics to the song at any given moment.
